<P><A href=3D"http://linux-newbie.sunsite.dk/">Linux Newbie =
Administrator=20
 Guide</A> <BR>by Stan and Peter Klimas =20
<P>This is a practical selection of the commands we use most often. =
Press =20
<TT>&lt;Tab&gt;</TT> to see the listing of all available command (on =
your PATH).=20
 On my small home system, it says there are 2595 executables on my =
PATH.&nbsp;=20
 Many of these "commands" can be accessed from your favourite GUI =
front-end=20
 (probably KDE or Gnome) by clicking on the right menu or button. They =
can all=20
be  run from the command line.&nbsp; Programs that require GUI have to =
be run=20
from a  terminal opened under a GUI. =20
<P><B>Legend:</B> <BR>&lt;&gt; =3D single special or function key on the =
keyboard.=20
 For example &lt;Ctrl&gt; indicates the "control" key. <BR><I>italic</I> =
=3D name=20
 of the file or variable you probably want to substitute with your own.  =

<BR><TT>fixed width</TT> =3D in-line Linux commands and filenames. =20
<P><B>Notes for the UNIX Clueless:</B> <BR>1. LINUX IS CASE-SENSITIVE. =
For=20
 example: Netscape, NETSCAPE and nEtscape are three different commands. =
Also=20
 my_filE, my_file, and my_FILE are three different files. Your user =
login name=20
 and password are also case sensitive. (This goes with the tradition of =
UNIX and=20
 the "c" programming language being case sensitive.) <BR>2. Filenames =
can be up=20
 to 256 characters long and can contain letters, numbers, "." (dot), "_" =

 (underscore), "-" (dash), plus some other not recommended characters. =
<BR>3.=20
 Files with names starting with "." are normally not shown by the =
<TT>ls</TT>=20
(list) or dir commands. Think of these files as "hidden". Use <TT>ls=20
 -a</TT>&nbsp; (list with the option "all") to see these files. <BR>4. =
"/" is an=20
 equivalent to DOS "\" (root directory, meaning the parent of all other=20
 directories). <BR>5. Under Linux, all directories appear under a single =

 directory tree (there are no DOS-style drive letters). <BR>6. In a=20
configuration  file, a line starting with # is a comment. =20
<H2><A name=3D"shortcuts"></A>7.1 Linux essential shortcuts and sanity=20
 commands</H2><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;F1&gt;</TT> <BR>Switch to =
the first=20
 text terminal. Under Linux you can have several (6 in standard setup) =
terminals=20
 opened at the same time. =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Fn&gt; </TT>(n=3D1..6) <BR>Switch to =
the nth=20
 text terminal. =20
<P><TT>tty</TT> <BR>Print the name of the terminal in which you are =
typing this=20
 command. =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;F7&gt;</TT> <BR>Switch to the first =
GUI=20
 terminal (if X-windows is running on this terminal). =20
<P>&nbsp;<TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Fn&gt; </TT>(n=3D7..12) =
<BR>Switch to the=20
 nth GUI terminal (if a GUI terminal is running on screen n-1). On =
default,=20
 nothing is running on terminals <BR>8 to 12, but you can run another =
server=20
 there. =20
<P>&nbsp;<TT>&lt;Tab&gt;</TT> <BR>(In a text terminal) Autocomplete the=20
 command&nbsp; if there is only one option, or else show all the =
available=20
 options. <BR>THIS SHORTCUT IS GREAT! It even works at LILO prompt! =20
<P>&nbsp;<TT>&lt;ArrowUp&gt;</TT> <BR>Scroll and edit the command =
history. Press=20
&lt; Enter&gt; to execute. =20
<P>&nbsp;<TT>&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;PgUp&gt;</TT> <BR>Scroll terminal output =
up. Work=20
 also at the login prompt, so you can scroll through your bootup =
messages. =20
<P>&nbsp;<TT>&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;PgDown&gt;</TT> <BR>Scroll terminal output =
down. =20
<P>&nbsp;<TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;+&gt;</TT> <BR>(in X-windows) =
Change to=20
 the next X-server resolution (if you set up the X-server to more than =
one=20
 resolution). For multiple resolutions on my standard SVGA card/monitor, =
I have=20
 the following line in the file <TT>/etc/X11/XF86Config</TT> (the first=20
 resolution starts on default, the largest determines the size of the =
"virtual=20
 screen"): <BR><TT>Modes "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "512x384" =
"480x300"=20
 "400x300" "1152x864"</TT>=20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;-&gt;</TT> <BR>(in X-windows) Change =
to the=20
 previous X-server resolution. =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;BkSpc&gt;</TT> <BR>(in X-windows) Kill =
the=20
 current X-windows server. Use if the X-windows server crushes and =
cannot be=20
 exited normally. =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Del&gt;</TT> <BR>Shut down the system =
and=20
 reboot. This is the normal shutdown command for a user at the text-mode =

console.  Don't just press the "reset" button for shutdown! =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;c</TT> <BR>Kill the current process (mostly in the =
text mode=20
 for small applications). =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;d</TT> <BR>Log out from the current terminal.&nbsp; =
See also=20
 the next command. =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;d</TT> <BR>Send [End-of-File] to the current process. =
Don't=20
 press it twice else you also log out (see the previous command). =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;s</TT> <BR>Stop the transfer to the terminal. =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;q</TT> <BR>Resume the transfer to the terminal. Try =
if your=20
 terminal mysteriously stops responding. =20
<P><TT>&lt;Ctrl&gt;z</TT> <BR>Send the current process to the =
background. =20
<P><TT>exit</TT> <BR>Logout. I can also use <TT>logout</TT> for the same =

 effect.&nbsp; (If you have started a second shell, e.g., using =
<TT>bash</TT>=20
the  second shell will be exited and you will be back in the first =
shell, not=20
logged  out.) =20
<P><TT>reset</TT> <BR>Restore a screwed-up terminal (a terminal showing =
funny=20
 characters) to default setting. Use if you tried to "cat" a binary =
file. You=20
may  not be able to see the command as you type it. =20
<P><TT>&lt;MiddleMouseButton&gt;</TT> <BR>Paste the text which is =
currently=20
 highlighted somewhere else. This is the normal "copy-paste" operation =
in=20
 Linux.&nbsp; (It doesn't work with Netscape and WordPerfect which use =
the MS=20
 Windows-style "copy-paste". It does work in the text terminal if you =
enabled=20
 "gpm" service using "setup".) Best used with a Linux-ready 3-button =
mouse=20
 (Logitech or similar) or else set "3-mouse button emulation"). =20
<P><TT>~</TT> <BR>(tilde) My home directory (normally the directory =20
<TT>/home/my_login_name</TT>). For example, the command <TT>cd=20
 ~/<I>my_dir</I></TT> will change my working&nbsp; directory to the =
subdirectory=20
 "<I>my_dir</I>" under my home directory.&nbsp; Typing just "cd" alone =
is an=20
 equivalent of the command "cd ~". =20
<P><TT>.</TT> <BR>(dot) Current directory. For example, =
<TT>./my_program</TT>=20
will attempt to execute the file "my_program" located in your current =
working=20
 directory. =20
<P><TT>..</TT> <BR>(two dots) Directory parent to the current one. For =
example,=20
 the command <TT>cd ..</TT> will change my current working directory one =
one=20
 level up. =20
<H2><A name=3D"sys_info_commands"></A>7.2 Common Linux commands--system=20
 info</H2><TT>pwd</TT> <BR>Print working directory, i.e., display the =
name of my=20
 current directory on the screen. =20
<P><TT>hostname</TT> <BR>Print the name of the local host (the machine =
on which=20
 you are working). Use<TT> netconf </TT>(as root) to change the name of =
the=20
 machine. =20
<P><TT>whoami</TT> <BR>Print my login name. =20
<P><TT>id <I>username</I></TT> <BR>Print user id (uid) and his/her group =
id=20
 (gid), effective id (if different than the real id) and the =
supplementary=20
 groups. =20
<P><TT>date</TT> <BR>Print or change the operating system date and time. =
E.g., I=20
 could change the date and time to 2000-12-31 23:57 using this command:  =

<BR><TT>date 123123572000</TT> <BR>To set the hardware (BIOS) clock from =
the=20
 system (Linux) clock, use the command (as root) <TT>setclock</TT>=20
<P><TT>time</TT> <BR>Determine the amount of time that it takes for a =
process to=20
 complete + other info. Don't confuse it with the <TT>date</TT> command. =
E.g. I=20
 can find out how long it takes to display a directory content using: =20
<BR><TT>time ls</TT>=20
<P><TT>who</TT> <BR>Determine the users logged on the machine. =20
<P><TT>rwho -a</TT> <BR>(=3Dremote who) Determine all users logged on =
your=20
 network. The rwho service must be enabled for this command to run. If =
it isn't,=20
 run setup as root to enable "rwho". =20
<P><TT>finger <I>user_name</I></TT> <BR>System info about a user. Try: =20
<TT>finger root</TT>=20
<P><TT>last</TT> <BR>Show listing of users last logged-in on your =
system. =20
<P><TT>history | more</TT> <BR>Show the last (1000 or so) commands =
executed from=20
 the command line on the current account. The "| more" causes the =
display to=20
stop  after each screenful. =20
<P><TT>uptime</TT> <BR>Show the amount of time since the last reboot. =20
<P><TT>ps</TT> <BR>(=3Dprint status) List the processes currently run by =
the=20
 current user. =20
<P><TT>ps axu | more</TT> <BR>List all the processes currently running, =
even=20
 those without the controlling terminal, together with the name of the =
user that=20
 owns each process. =20
<P><TT>top</TT> <BR>Keep listing the currently running processes, sorted =
by cpu=20
 usage (top users first). In KDE, you can get GUI-based Ktop from =
"K"menu under=20
 "System"-"Task Manager" (or by executing "ktop" in an X-terminal). =20
<P><TT>uname -a</TT> <BR>(=3D Unix name with option "all") Info on your =
(local)=20
 server. I can also use <TT>guname</TT> (in X-window terminal) to =
display the=20
 info more nicely. =20
<P><TT>free</TT> <BR>Memory info (in kilobytes). =20
<P><TT>df -h</TT> <BR>(=3Ddisk free) Print disk info about all the =
filesystems (in=20
 human-readable form) =20
<P><TT>du / -bh | more</TT> <BR>(=3Ddisk usage) Print detailed disk =
usage for each=20
 subdirectory starting at the "/" (root) directory (in human legible =
form). =20
<P><TT>cat /proc/cpuinfo</TT> <BR>Cpu info--it show the content of the =
file =20
<TT>cpuinfo</TT>. Note that the files in the <TT>/proc</TT> directory =
are not=20
 real files--they are hooks to look at information available to the =
kernel. =20
<P><TT>cat /proc/interrupts</TT> <BR>List the interrupts in use. =20
<P><TT>cat /proc/version</TT> <BR>Linux version and other info =20
<P><TT>cat /proc/filesystems</TT> <BR>Show the types of filesystems =
currently in=20
 use. =20
<P><TT>cat /etc/printcap</TT> <BR>Show the setup of printers. =20
<P><TT>lsmod</TT> <BR>(As root. Use <TT>/sbin/lsmod</TT> to execute this =
command=20
 when you are a non-root user.) Show the kernel modules currently =
loaded. =20
<P><TT>set|more</TT> <BR>Show the current user environment. =20
<P><TT>echo $PATH</TT> <BR>Show the content of the environment variable =
"PATH".=20
 This command can be used to show other environment variables as well. =
Use "set"=20
 to see the full environment. =20
<P><TT>dmesg | less</TT> <BR>Print kernel messages (the content of the =
so-called=20
 kernel ring buffer). Press "q" to quit "less". Use <TT>less=20
 /var/log/dmesg</TT>&nbsp; to see what "dmesg" dumped into this file =
right after=20
 the last system bootup. <BR>&nbsp;=20
<H2><A name=3D"Basic_operations"></A>7.3 Basic =
operations</H2><TT><I>any_command =20
</I>--help |more</TT> <BR>Display a brief help on a command (works with =
most=20
 commands). "--help" works similar to DOS "/h" switch. The "more" pipe =
is needed=20
 if the output is longer than one screen. =20
<P><TT>man <I>topic</I></TT> <BR>Display the contents of the system =
manual pages=20
 (help) on the topic. Try <TT>man man</TT> first. Press "q" to quit the =
viewer.=20
 The command <TT>info <I>topic</I></TT> works similar and may contain =
more=20
 up-to-date information. Manual pages can be hard to read. Try =20
<TT><I>any_command</I> --help</TT> for short, easy to digest help on a =
command.=20
 If more info needed, have a look to the directory <TT>/usr/doc</TT>. To =
display=20
 manual page from a specific section, I may use something like in this=20
 example:&nbsp; <TT>man 3 exit</TT> (this displays an info on the =
command =20
<TT>exit</TT> from section 3 of the manual pages). =20
<P><TT>apropos <I>topic</I></TT> <BR>Give me the list of the commands =
that have=20
 something to to do with my topic. =20
<P><TT>help command</TT> <BR>Display brief info on a bash (shell) =
build-in=20
 command. =20
<P><TT>ls</TT> <BR>List the content of the current directory. Under =
Linux, the=20
 command "dir" is an alias to ls. Many users have "ls" to be an alias to =
"ls=20
 --color". =20
<P><TT>ls -al |more</TT> <BR>List the content of the current directory, =
all=20
 files (also those starting with a dot), and in a long form. Pipe the =
output=20
 through the "more" command, so that the display pauses after each =
screenful. =20
<P><TT>cd <I>directory</I></TT> <BR>Change directory. Using "cd" without =
the=20
 directory name will take you to your home directory. "cd -" will take =
you to=20
 your previous directory and is a convenient way to toggle between two=20
 directories. "cd .." will take you one directory up. =20
<P><TT>cp <I>source destination</I></TT> <BR>Copy files. E.g., <TT>cp=20
 /home/stan/existing_file_name .</TT>&nbsp; will copy a file to my =
current=20
 working directory. Use the "-r" option (for recursive) to copy the =
contents of=20
 whole directories, e.g. , <TT>cp -r my_existing/dir/ ~&nbsp;</TT> will =
copy a=20
 subdirectory under my current working directory to my home directory. =20
<P><TT>mcopy <I>source destination</I></TT> <BR>Copy a file from/to a =
DOS=20
 filesystem (no mounting necessary). E.g., <TT>mcopy a:\autoexec.bat =
~/junk =20
</TT>. See <TT>man mtools</TT> for related commands: mdir, mcd, mren, =
mmove,=20
 mdel, mmd, mrd, mformat .... =20
<P><TT>mv s<I>ource destination</I></TT> <BR>Move or rename files. The =
same=20
 command is used for moving and renaming files and directories. =20
<P><TT>ln <I>source destination</I></TT> <BR>Create a hard link called =20
<I>destination</I> to the file called <I>source</I>. The link appears as =
a copy=20
 of the original files, but in reality only one copy of the file is =
kept, just=20
 two (or more) directory entries point to it. Any changes the file are=20
 automatically visible throughout. When one directory entry is removed, =
the=20
 other(s) stay(s) intact. The limitation of the hard links are: the =
files have=20
to  be on the same filesystem, hard links to directories or special =
files are=20
 impossible. =20
<P><TT>ln -s <I>source destination</I></TT> <BR>Create a symbolic (soft) =
link=20
 called "destination" to the file called "source". The symbolic link =
just=20
 specifies a path where to look for the file. In contradistinction to =
hard=20
links,  the source and destination don't not have to tbe on the same =
filesystem.=20
In  comparison to hard links, the drawback of symbolic links are: if the =

original  file is removed, the link is "broken", symbolic links can also =
create=20
circular  references (like circular references in spreadsheets or =
databases,=20
e.g., "a"  points to "b" and "b" points back to "a"). =20
<P><TT>rm<I> files</I></TT> <BR>Remove (delete) files. You must own the =
file in=20
 order to be able to remove it. On many systems, you will be asked or=20
 confirmation of deleation, if you don't want this, use the "-f" =
(=3Dforce)=20
option,  e.g., <TT>rm -f *</TT>&nbsp; will remove all files in my =
current=20
working  directory, no questions asked. =20
<P><TT>mkdir <I>directory</I></TT> <BR>Make a new directory. =20
<P><TT>rmdir <I>directory</I></TT> <BR>Remove an empty directory. =20
<P><TT>rm -r <I>files</I></TT> <BR>(recursive remove) Remove files, =
directories,=20
 and their subdirectories. Careful with this command as root--you can =
easily=20
 remove all files on the system with such a command executed on the top =
of your=20
 directory tree, and there is no undelete in Linux (yet). But if you =
really=20
 wanted to do it (reconsider), here is how (as root): <TT>rm -rf /*</TT> =

<P><TT>cat <I>filename</I> | more</TT> <BR>View the content of a text =
file=20
 called "filename", one page a time. The "|" is the "pipe" symbol (on =
many=20
 American keyboards it shares the key with "\") The pipe makes the =
output stop=20
 after each screenful. For long files, it is sometimes convenient to use =
the=20
 commands head and tail that display just the beginning and the end of =
the file.=20
 If you happened to use "cat" a binary file and your terminal displays =
funny=20
 characters afterwards, you can restore it with the command "reset". =20
<P><TT>less <I>filename</I></TT> <BR>Scroll through a content of a text =
file.=20
 Press q when done. "Less" is roughly equivalent to "more" , the command =
you=20
know  from DOS, although very often "less" is more convenient than =
"more". =20
<P><TT>pico <I>filename</I></TT> <BR>Edit a text file using the simple =
and=20
 standard text editor called <TT>pico</TT>. =20
<P><TT>pico -w <I>filename</I></TT> <BR>Edit a text file, while =
disabling the=20
 long line wrap. Handy for editing configuration files, e.g.=20
<TT>/etc/fstab</TT>. =20
<P><TT>find / -name "<I>filename</I>"</TT> <BR>Find the file called =
"filename"=20
 on your filesystem starting the search from the root directory "/". The =

 "filename" may contain wildcards (*,?). =20
<P><TT>locate <I>filename</I></TT> <BR>Find the file name of which =
contains the=20
 string "filename". Easier and faster than the previous command but =
depends on a=20
 database that normally rebuilds at night. =20
<P><TT>./<I>program_name</I></TT> <BR>Run an executable in the current=20
 directory, which is not on your PATH. =20
<P><TT>touch <I>filename</I></TT> <BR>Change the date/time stamp of the =
file =20
<I><TT>filename</TT></I> to the current time. Create an empty file if =
the file=20
 does not exist. =20
<P><TT>xinit</TT> <BR>Start a barebone X-windows server (without a =
windows=20
 manager). =20
<P><TT>startx</TT> <BR>Start an X-windows server and the default windows =

 manager. Works like typing "win" under DOS with Win3.1 =20
<P><TT>startx -- :1</TT> <BR>Start another X-windows session on the =
display 1=20
 (the default is opened on display 0). You can have several GUI =
terminals=20
running  concurrently. Switch between them using=20
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;F7&gt;, &lt; Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;F8&gt;, =
etc. =20
<P><TT>xterm</TT> <BR>(in X terminal) Run a simple X-windows =
terminal.&nbsp;=20
 Typing <TT>exit</TT> will close it.&nbsp; There are other, more =
advanced=20
 "virtual" terminals for X-windows. I like the popular ones: =
<TT>konsole</TT>=20
and  <TT>kvt</TT> (both come with kde) and <TT>gnome-terminal</TT> =
(comes with=20
 gnome).&nbsp; If you need something really fancy-looking, try =
<TT>Eterm</TT>. =20
<P><TT>xboing</TT> <BR>(in X terminal). Very nice, old-fashioned game. =
Many=20
 small games/programs are probably installed on your system. I also like =
=20
<TT>xboard</TT> (chess). =20
<P><TT>shutdown -h now</TT> <BR>(as root) Shut down the system to a =
halt. Mostly=20
 used for a remote shutdown. Use &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Del&gt; for =
a=20
 shutdown at the console (which can be done by any user). =20
<P><TT>halt</TT> <BR><TT>reboot</TT> <BR>(as root, two commands) Halt or =
reboot=20
 the machine. Used for remote shutdown, simpler to type than the =
previous=20
 command. <BR>&nbsp;=20
<H2>Network apps</H2><TT>netscape</TT> <BR>(in X terminal) Run netscape=20
 (requires a separate Netscape installation). The current versions of =
Netscape=20
 (4.x) are known to be big and buggy. They occasionally crash by =
vanishing (no=20
 other harm done). Also, when not connected to the network , Netscape =
likes to=20
 refuse to do anything (looks like it hanged)-it revives when you =
connect. =20
<P><TT>netscape -display <I>host</I>:0.0</TT> <BR>(in X terminal) Run =
netscape=20
 on the current machine and direct the output to machine named "host" =
display 0=20
